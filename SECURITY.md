# Security

## Scope

This repository contains one bounded Intelligent Contract, direct tests, a five-validator GLSim test, and an opt-in StudioNet smoke test. It has no frontend, backend, database, token, payout, proxy upgrade, or repository secret.

## Trust model

Untrusted evidence is delimited as data, model outputs use closed schemas, and validator replay must agree before semantic state is stored.

The deployer is the grower and controls sign setup, observation rounds, and the final HARVEST or WAIT decision.

## Implemented controls

- Concrete immutable GenVM runner hash; no floating runner dependency.
- Address normalization, explicit role separation, collection caps, one-time actions, and lifecycle locks.
- Bounded text plus strict `[EXPECTED]` and `[LLM_ERROR]` failure classes.
- Sorted, delimited evidence packets and independent validator replay.
- Storage is copied before nondeterministic callbacks; static audit requires zero callback reads from `self`.
- No cross-contract calls, fund custody, transfer, automated purchase, external deletion, or webhook.
- `.env`, caches, artifacts, wallet files, and local secrets are ignored. Live wallets are encrypted outside the workspace.

## Contract-specific safety properties

- At least two grower-defined signs freeze before monitoring begins.
- Only the grower can record an observation or make the harvest decision.
- Every round retains its mask, signal, decision, and note.
- The AI signal cannot harvest a crop or override the grower.

## Residual risks

- Observations are self-declared and are not verified against sensors or images.
- The result is not agronomy, food-safety, weather, or regulatory advice.
- A READY signal only means the stored observation supports the frozen signs.

Do not use this contract to make legal, medical, financial, employment, admission, credit, or physical-safety decisions beyond the explicit low-risk policy in its source. A new use case requires a fresh deployment and independent domain review.

## Reporting

Report vulnerabilities privately to the repository owner with the contract name, affected method, reproduction, expected invariant, and impact. Never include private keys, wallet passwords, or personal data.
